    <h2>Calico Cat</h2>
    <div class="calicocontainer">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          A calico cat is a domestic cat with a coat that is typically 25% to
          75% white with large orange and black patches (or sometimes cream and
          grey patches). They are the Maryland state cat. They are almost
          exclusively female except under rare genetic conditions. A calico is
          not to be confused with a tortoiseshell, which has a mostly mottled
          coat of black/orange or grey/cream with relatively few to no white
          markings.
          <br /><br />

          “Calico” refers only to a color pattern on the fur, from colorful
          printed Calico fabric, not to a cat breed or any reference to any
          other traits, such as its eyes <br /><br />

          In my opinion, they are one of the cutest cats around. If you would
          like to adopt one, make sure to visit the adoption center.

    <h2>The Stylish Tuxedo Cat</h2>
    <div class="calicocontainer">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          A tuxedo cat, or Felix cat, is a bicolor cat with a white and black
          coat. They are called "tuxedo" cats because they appear to be wearing
          the type of black tie formal wear commonly known in the United States
          and Canada as a tuxedo. The tuxedo pattern is not limited to the color
          black, but the name is typically reserved for black and white cats.
          <br /><br />

          Most tuxedo cats are also black-mask cats, a common name for felines
          who, due to their facial coloration, look as if they are wearing a
          black mask over their eyes, and often over their entire head.<br /><br />

          To be considered a true tuxedo cat, the feline's coloring should
          consist of a solid black coat, with white fur limited to the paws,
          belly, chest, throat, and often the chin sometimes the tail, although
          many tuxedo cats appear to sport goatees, due to the black coloration
          of their mandible—that is, the lower jaw and chin.
          <br /><br />
          One of our users decided to write a poem for our tuxedo cat.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em
            >Tuxedo cat, tuxedo cat. <br />
            I wish you were mine! <br />
            Oh wait! <br />
            Just click the link <br />
            Fill out the form And he shall be yours!
